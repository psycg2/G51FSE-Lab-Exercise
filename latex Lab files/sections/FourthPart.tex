\subsection{Comments about the module}

This module has been interesting so far, possibly because of the coordinator,  Max Wilson.  Though, the feedback from non assessed labs could have been better, i.e. receive a mark for them would really help.

\subsection{What I have learned in this module}
I have learned how to work in a group and what it means to be dependent on other people to carry out a task \textbf{together}.
